2. JSX
- Stand for JavaScriptXML
- Allows for writing HTML elements with JS code
- JSX is converted to JS on browser using babel.js
    - Babel is a library which transpiles JSX to pure JS,

- when using multiple HTML inside of a JSX element you need to wrap them in an outer HTML element
    - meaning a div, or header or etc.
