# Explore

Congratulations for making to this far. You are are unstoppable. So far you have learned lots of concepts and also built several mini-projects. I believe those mini-projects have helped you to understand React very well. After this, you can work on a sole or group React project. You can also expand your skill by using different packages (classnames, lodash, react-helmet, recharts, etc.), implementing PWA, styled components and CSS libraries with React application. In addition, learn SEO, accessibility, responsiveness and browser compatibility. Explore more and increase your knowledge in the domain. Read the [React documentation](https://reactjs.org/). Now, you should feel confident enough about your React skill and you should also start applying for entry or junior softer developer or front end developer positions. No one will tell you that you are read for a job, so you should make yourself ready.
