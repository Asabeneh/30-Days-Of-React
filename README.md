This project provides offline access to the "30 Days of React" learning challenge using MkDocs for documentation serving.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher
- [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/)

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Asabeneh/30-Days-Of-React.git
cd 30-Days-Of-React
```

### 2. Set up a virtual environment (recommended)
```sh
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `.venv\Scripts\activate`
```

### 3. Install MkDocs
```sh
pip install mkdocs mkdocs-material
```

### 4. Serve the documentation
```sh
mkdocs serve
```

This will start a local server (usually at http://127.0.0.1:8000/) where you can browse the documentation offline.

## Virtual Environment Management

### Option A: Manual Activation (Default)
If you're using a virtual environment manually, you **must** activate it every time you start a new terminal session:

```sh
source .venv/bin/activate  # âœ… Required before running mkdocs serve
mkdocs serve
```

### Option B: Automatic Virtual Environment Activation (Advanced Users)
**This section is only for users who want automatic virtual environment activation using direnv.**

If you prefer automatic activation when entering the project directory, you can use [direnv](https://direnv.net/):

#### Setup direnv (one-time installation):
```sh
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt install direnv

# macOS
brew install direnv

# Add to your shell profile (~/.bashrc, ~/.zshrc, etc.)
eval "$(direnv hook bash)"  # for bash
eval "$(direnv hook zsh)"   # for zsh
```

#### Configure automatic activation for this project:
```sh
# In your project directory
echo "source .venv/bin/activate" > .envrc
direnv allow
```

After this setup, your virtual environment will automatically activate when you `cd` into the project directory.

## Additional Notes

- All course content is located in the `docs/` folder
- Configuration settings can be found in `mkdocs.yml`
- The virtual environment folder is named `.venv` to follow Python conventions

## Troubleshooting

- If `mkdocs serve` fails, ensure your virtual environment is activated and dependencies are installed
- On Windows, use backslashes for paths: `.venv\Scripts\activate`
- If you encounter permission issues with direnv, make sure it's properly integrated with your shell

Happy learning! ðŸš€
