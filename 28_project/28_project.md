# Projects

Create Read Delete and Update(CRUD)
Most applications use CRUD operations. For instance, you have been Reading(R) data by fetching from the cat API and countries API. You have been creating(C) when you use input field and item. However, we did not implement updating and deleting functionality so far. Since CRUD is a common operation almost in all big applications it is good to know how to implement it. In this section, we will develop a small application which has creating, reading, updating and deleting functionality.

The todo list is a very common example to learn and master CRUD operations in almost every libraries and frameworks. I would also recommend you to develop a todo list, note taking or a tinny blog application for the sake of mastering CRUD.

In this section, you and I will develop an old version of twitter post.

# Exercises

1. Develop the following application, [twitter tweets](https://www.30daysofreact.com/day-28/twitter-clone). The application has all the CRUD operations.
